# Audacity Basics
*Created by Noah McAllister*

The purpose of this tutorial is to give a brief *startup* guide to setting up audacity and recording audio. The tutorial will cover setting up Recording and Playback Devices, Recording Audio, and Exporting audio files out of Audacity.

This tutorial is for anyone who needs to record audio but doesn't know where to start in the program. This tutorial is suitable for all age groups and should be easy to follow even if you aren't tech savvy!

Before beginning make sure you have the latest version of Audacity available.

Since I am using a Corsair Headset, I selected that device for both playback and recording. If you are using an external microphone, select that device for a recording device and your headphones/speaker for playback.

Congratulations! You added your devices and now have audio. Your audacity should look like this when everything is working correctly when you record. (look below)

## Recording Audio

Now that we added our devices, we want the best audio possible for our devices. To achieve this we will be changing the rate to 48000hz. 48000hz is the professional standard for audio and video.  

1. Right-click on the empty space and add a Stereo Track

2. Click the little dropdown arrow on the track ---->>>> Rate ---->>>> 48000hz

3. Record your audio using the red record button or by pressing the *R* key.
